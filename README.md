# VBA of Wall Street
# Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze 2017 and 2018 all stocks performance using the visual basic application. Using the refactoring code to determine whether refactoring code would make VBA scrip run faster and yeilds a better result.

# Results
Bases on the analysis 2017 is a good year to invest. The highest return in year 2017 is 199.4% for DQ corp and the lowest is -7.2% for TERP.  However 2018 is not a good year to invest.  Based on the all stocks analysis for 2018 almost all stocks have a negative return except for ENPH and RUN. Considering overall results, it would be better to go with ENPH stocks as it has the most favorable result (132% & 82% over two years.)

<br/> As for the refactoring of the script, this improved the performance, as the previous code took 1.040 seconds whereas the new code takes only 1.023 seconds and 1.040 to 1.031 for 2017 and 2018 respectively. Therefore, it is better using the refactored code.
